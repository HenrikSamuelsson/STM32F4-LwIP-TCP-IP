# Abbreviations #
Various abbreviations more or less related to the project.  

**ARP**  
Address Resolution Protocol  
Protocol used for resolution of network layer addresses into link layer addresses. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**BSD**  
Berkley Software Distribution  
Unix operating system derivative developed and distributed by the University of California, Berkeley, from 1977 to 1995. Today the term BSD is often used non-specifically to refer to any of the BSD descendants which together form a branch of the family of Unix-like operating systems. 

**BSP**  
Board Support Package  
Layer in the STM32CubeF4 architecture that offers a set of APIs related to the hardware components mounted on the boards.  

**DHCP**  
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  
Used on IP networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses for interfaces and services. Enables computers request of IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from a server, reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to configure these settings manually. This protocol is supported by LwIP.

**DNS**  
Domain Name Server
Computer hardware or software server that implements a network service for providing responses to queries against a directory service. It translates an often humanly-meaningful, text-based identifier to a system-internal, often numeric identification or addressing component. This protocol is supported by LwIP. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**GDB**  
GNU Debugger  
A portable debugger that runs on many systems and works for many programming languages.  

**GMAC**  
Gigabit Media Access Controller  
An interface between the MAC device and the PHY. The interface defines speeds up to 1000 Mbit/s, and is backwards compatible with the MII specification.  

**ICMP**  
Internet Control Message Protocol  
Used for network maintenance and debugging. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**IGMP**  
Internet Group Management Protocol  
For multicast traffic management. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**IP**  
Internet Protocol  
Important commonly used protocol for Internet communication. Provides functionality for routing and relaying of datagrams across network boundaries. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**LwIP**  
Lightweight IP  
An open source TCP/IP stack designed for embedded systems.  

**MAC**  
Media Access Control  
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.  

**MII**  
Media Independent Interface  
A standard interface used to connect a Ethernet MAC block to a PHY chip.  

**OSI**  
Open System Interconnection  
A conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.

**PCB**  
Protocol Control Block  
Module responsible for handling communication based on a protocol. The protocol can be TCP or UDP.  

**PHY**  
PHYsical  
An abbreviation for the physical layer of the OSI model and refers to the circuitry required to implement physical layer functions.  

**PPP**  
Point to Point Protocol  
A data link protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes. It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption, and compression. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**PPPoE**  
Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet  
Network protocol for encapsulating PPP frames inside Ethernet frames. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**SNMP**  
Simple Network Management Protocol  
Collects and organizes information about managed devices on IP networks can also modify the information to change device behavior. This protocol is supported by LwIP.    

**TCP**  
Transmission Control Protocol  
Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network. This protocol is supported by LwIP.  

**UDP**  
User Datagram Protocol
A simple connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. This protocol is supported by LwIP.
