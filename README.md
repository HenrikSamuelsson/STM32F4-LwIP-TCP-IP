# STM32F4 LwIP TCP/IP
Development of an application running Internet communication based on a STM32F4 Discovery kit. The exact processor version mounted on the kit is a STM32F407 VGT6.  

It is possible to develop C and C++ code for STM32F4 by the use of [GNU ARM Eclipse](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/install/ "GNU ARM Eclipse"). This environment is used for this project.  

Toolchain version used is [gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download "gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3").
