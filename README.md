# STM32F4 LwIP TCP/IP
Development of an application running Internet communication based on a STM32F4 Discovery kit.

The exact processor version mounted on the kit is a STM32F407VGT6. This version comes packed in a 100 pins LQFP and has 1 M (bytes) of flash.    

It is possible to develop C and C++ code for STM32F4 by the use of [GNU ARM Eclipse](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/install/ "GNU ARM Eclipse"). This environment is used for the this project.
